# New domain name: https://greasyfork.dpdns.org/ 

Temporary use of cn2 server 

# English [English](/README_English.md) 

Monitoring: https://status.nextgo.dpdns.org/status/greasyfork 

The new domain name is https://nextgo.dpdns.org/ (This domain name is a redirect. Make sure to update it easily in the future without much effort.) 

It will have the following restrictions: 

IP addresses from Japan will be blocked. 

Traditional Chinese will be redirected to https://greasyfork.org/zh-TW 

3. Due to the low server bandwidth, human-machine verification will be conducted. 

4. It may not be possible to log in. PS: I haven't tried it. 

This domain is a mirror of greasyfork.org. 

The download address is update.greasyfork.dpdns.org. 

Please note the following: 

Due to the particularity of the .us.kg domain name, if you encounter a redirection to anti-fraud pages, it is usually because you are using the operator's DNS. You can change the DNS to another one. Here are a few options I list for you. 

Alibaba Cloud: 223.5.5.5 

Tencent Cloud: 119.29.29.29 

114 DNS: 114.114.114.114 

360 DNS: 101.198.198.198 

Google: 8.8.8.8 

Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1 

Finally, I hope nextgo.us.kg won't be blocked!
